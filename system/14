#'&' -  Suppose you issue the command kwrite then kwrite will open in a new
#window, but the terminal will not receive a new prompt until that
#window is closed. On the other hand, 'kwrite &'# will open the new window
#in the same way, but the terminal will receive the new prompt immediately
#and may be used in parallel with kwrite
