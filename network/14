/etc/hosts

#etc - system configuration folder
# In computer networking, localhost is a hostname that means this computer.
# It is used to access the network services that are running on the host
# via the loopback network interface. Using the loopback interface
# bypasses any local network interface hardware.
#
# broadcasthost is simply the last IP address in your subnet. For example,
# if your Mac has an IP address of 192.168.1.2 with a subnet
# mask of 255.255.255.0 then the last IP address in the subnet, and
# the broadcasthost is 192.168.1.255 Any traffic sent to broadcasthost
# is automatically passed to every device in the subnet.
